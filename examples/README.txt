The files in this folder beginning with "iisignature" contain useful
python functionality which builds on the functionality in iisignature.
They are not part of the iisignature package so that iisignature does
not need to have theano as a dependency, but they are likely to be useful
as they are.

The files beginning with "demo" are just demonstrations of this functionality.
